# COMP323-Project-1
A project for COMP323 that implements threaded sorting in C

Project 1 - Multithreaded Sorting Algorithm

COMP323

My program was compiled with the following command:
"gcc -pthread -Wall -o proj1.out sisinger_andrew_proj1_COMP323_v2.c"

I have included a makefile to simplify this. 
Type "make" in the directory to compile.
Type "make clean" to remove last compiled executable.


Run the program by:
"./proj1"

Enter the number of random integers to sort and the program will use two sorting 
threads and one merge thread (with a final bubblesort) to return the answer!

Thanks,
Andy Sisinger
